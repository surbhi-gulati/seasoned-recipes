# Seasoned-Recipes
A networking site for foodies!

# Who are we
Seasoned Recipes is a social application for foodies to connect and expand their cooking horizons! 

We offer users with the ability to browse and curate recipe collections of interest on to their profile. Users have the ability to
search for recipes from a beautiful UI where they can filter by various interests such as cuisine and dietary preferences. Additionally,
we enable users to share recipes of interests by posting them on a social feed. Users can interact with posts of other users that they
choose to follow, and they can also comment on and like the posts that they engage with.
